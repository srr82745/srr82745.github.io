          <p> As a Fashion Merchandising Major at the University of Georgia,
              I guess you could say I have a Passion For Fashion! This passion
              has fueled me to try and turn a love into a career, as they always
            say, if you love what you do you'll never work a day in your life.</P>
          <p> So, my first step was finding my niche. My favorite thing to do
              is to scope out the latest trends and beauty products, put together outfits
              and show others so that they can be inspired! The way I do this is
              through my Youtube Channel, SavannahRoseBeauty!</P>
